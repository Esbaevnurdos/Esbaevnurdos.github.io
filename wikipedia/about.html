                There is an unsupported conclusion with an orphan reference. To wit: "[…] The orbits of the inner planets, including of the Earth, are similarly displaced by the same gravitational forces, so the movement of the Sun has little effect on the relative positions of the Earth and the Sun or on solar irradiance on the Earth as a function of time.[140] […]"

            <h3>Checking footnote 140 reveals:</h3>
            <p>Retraction of: Scientific Reports 10.1038/s41598-019-45584-3, published online 24 June 2019 The Editors have retracted this Article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding the interpretation of how the Earth-Sun distance changes over time and that some of the assumptions on which analyses presented in the Article are based are incorrect.The analyses presented in the section entitled “Effects of SIM on a temperature in the terrestrial hemispheres” are based on the assumption that the orbits of the Earth and the Sun about the Solar System barycenter are uncorrelated, so that the Earth-Sun distance changes by an amount comparable to the Sun-barycenter distance. Post-publication peer review has shown that this assumption is inaccurate because the motions of the Earth and the Sun are primarily due to Jupiter and the other giant planets, which accelerate the Earth and the Sun in nearly the same direction, and thereby generate highly-correlated motions in the Earth and Sun. Current ephemeris calculations [1,2] show that the Earth-Sun distance varies over a timescale of a few centuries by substantially less than the amount reported in this article. As a result the Editors no longer have confidence in the conclusions presented. S. I. Zharkov agrees with the retraction. V. V. Zharkova, E. Popova, and S. J. Shepherd disagree with the retraction.

            <p>The Youtube video is enigmatic. There are no explanation for any of it, just a few spreadsheets (with a mix of French and English). I don't know if the equations are correct... If you think the NASA numbers are incorrect, you should write a paper about it, explaining what is wrong with the current numbers, showing your math and/or your process, get published in a reputable journal, and then we can consider adjusting the article.

                density of a celestial body in gr/km^3 at a given kilometre starting by zero at centre = (1000*((e)^(-0,00025*((km since centre, use only the number not the unit)-((43149*((LOG10(((celestial body mass in gr, but only using the number not the unit)^(1/5))+500000))^1,1))-189573)))))*((((COS((km since centre, use only the number not the unit)^0,45))*0,01))+5)
                applying that to the sun, we understand the comment : the centre of the sun has a density of 1238,8 g/cm^3, not 162.2 g/cm3</p>
